## Key Contributions

### 1. Multi-hop Question Answering
Our system implements sophisticated multi-hop reasoning capabilities, allowing it to answer complex questions that require connecting multiple pieces of information across a knowledge graph. This approach significantly improves the quality and depth of responses compared to traditional single-hop systems.

### 2. Educational Personalization
The system is specifically tailored for educational contexts, with features that:
- Adapt explanations based on student level
- Provide contextual learning paths
- Support progressive difficulty scaling
- Enable personalized content delivery

### 3. Knowledge Graph Integration
We leverage structured knowledge representations to:
- Maintain semantic relationships between concepts
- Enable efficient traversal of related information
- Support complex query resolution
- Provide explainable reasoning paths

## Technical Implementation

The system architecture incorporates:

- **Graph Neural Networks** for knowledge representation learning
- **Natural Language Processing** for query understanding
- **Multi-hop reasoning algorithms** for complex question resolution
- **Web deployment framework** for practical accessibility

## Applications and Impact

This research has significant implications for:

### Educational Technology
- Intelligent tutoring systems
- Adaptive learning platforms
- Automated assessment tools
- Personalized curriculum design

### Information Retrieval
